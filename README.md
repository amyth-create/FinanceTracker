# Finance Tracker

A clean, completely offline personal-finance app for Android. Built natively in Kotlin with Room (SQLite), Material 3, MVVM, and Navigation Component. No internet, no ads, no tracking, no subscriptions — my financial data stays on my device.

Built as a personal project with the help of Google Gemini.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — a gradient balance hero, a month selector to browse any month, and at-a-glance insight cards:
  - **Lifestyle spend** — Food + Shopping + Fun combined, with its share of the month's spending, so discretionary outlay is obvious
  - **Insights** — top category, spend vs last month (colour-coded), daily average, and projected month-end total
  - **Recurring & subscriptions** — automatically detects repeating payments (same category + note across 3+ months) and estimates the next date
- **Add transaction** — pick income or expense, choose a category, set the amount, date, and an optional note
- **Transactions list** — full history **grouped under date headers** with a per-day net total, filter chips (All / Expenses / Income), and tap-to-delete
- **CSV import / export** — export your history and re-import it (or another app's data); unknown categories are created automatically
- **Reports** — interactive, tap anything to read exact figures:
  - **Single month** or **compare two months** side-by-side (category-by-category difference in € and %)
  - **Category donut** (tap a slice), a **monthly bar chart** with value labels, and a **balance-over-time trend line** across your whole history
- **Future payments (Planned)** — jot down a payment you plan to make on a future date; **tick it off when you actually pay** and it logs a real transaction (dated today) that flows into your totals, charts, and history. Un-ticking removes it
- **Reminders** — a notification on the morning of a planned payment's date (survives reboots)
- **Categories** — 13 default expense + 7 default income categories, all editable; add custom categories with your own emoji + colour
- **Offline-first** — everything is stored locally in `finance_tracker.db`; no internet permission, no ads, no tracking

## Screens

The app is a single Activity with bottom navigation between five destinations:

- `DashboardFragment` — balance hero, month selector, insight cards, recurring detection, recent transactions
- `TransactionsFragment` — full history grouped by day, with filters and CSV import/export
- `ReportsFragment` — interactive donut, trend line, monthly bars, and single/compare modes
- `PlannedFragment` — future payments you can tick off into real transactions
- `CategoriesFragment` — manage default and custom categories

`AddTransactionFragment` is the entry form, opened via the central **+** button.

## Getting the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FinanceTracker.git
cd FinanceTracker
```

---

## Build and run from Android Studio

1. **Install Android Studio** — https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Open the project** — File → Open → select the `FinanceTracker` folder (do not use *New Project*)
3. **Wait for Gradle sync** — first sync downloads all dependencies (1–3 minutes). Wait until the status bar reads *Gradle sync finished*.
4. **Pick a device:**
   - **Physical phone:** enable Developer Options (Settings → About Phone → tap *Build Number* 7 times), turn on **USB Debugging**, plug the phone into your computer, and accept the debug prompt
   - **Emulator:** Tools → Device Manager → create any virtual device with API 26+
5. **Press the green ▶ Run button.** Android Studio builds, installs, and launches the app.

---

## Build a shareable APK (for friends)

If you'd rather hand a friend an installable file than have them open Android Studio:

```bash
# from the project root
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK lands at:

```
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Send that file. To install it, the receiver needs to:

1. Copy `app-debug.apk` to their Android phone (USB, email, Drive, whatever)
2. Open it from the file manager
3. Approve the *Install from unknown sources* prompt for that file manager
4. Tap **Install**

> Debug APKs are signed with the auto-generated debug key, which is fine for personal use. To publish on the Play Store you'd need to generate a release keystore and switch the build type to `release`.

You can also publish the APK as a **Release** on GitHub (Releases → Draft a new release → attach `app-debug.apk`) so anyone can download it from the repo page.

## Customising

**Currency.** Currency formatting lives in `app/src/main/java/com/personal/financetracker/util/Formatters.kt`:

```kotlin
private val currencyFormat = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.GERMANY)
```

Out of the box this renders amounts as Euros (€). Change the `Locale` to suit your country — for example `Locale.UK` for GBP (£), `Locale.US` for USD ($), or `Locale("en", "IN")` for INR (₹).

**Default categories.** Edit `defaultExpenseCategories` and `defaultIncomeCategories` in `data/Category.kt`. They are only seeded on first launch (when the categories table is empty), so to re-seed wipe app data or uninstall and reinstall.

**Theme & colours.** Tweak `res/values/colors.xml` and `res/values/themes.xml`.

---

## Data and privacy

All data is stored locally in a SQLite database file named `finance_tracker.db`, inside the app's private storage on the device. Nothing is sent off-device — the app declares no internet permission.

The only permissions used are `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (to show planned-payment reminders) and `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` (to restore reminders after a reboot). CSV export/import goes through the system share/file-picker, so you stay in control of where data goes.

Uninstalling the app deletes the database. The app database is at schema **version 2**; upgrading from an older build runs a migration that adds the `planned_payments` table without touching existing data.

---

## Roadmap / nice-to-haves

- Budgets and per-category limits with progress rings
- Search + advanced filters (date range, amount) across transactions
- Configurable reminder time (e.g. the evening before)
- Surface upcoming planned payments on the Dashboard
- Cloud backup (optional, opt-in)

PRs and ideas welcome.
